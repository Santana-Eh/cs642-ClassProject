Using Docker to build an secure infrastructure and application

Make sure you create a separate directory for each application created under Docker 

For example, if you are downloading Nginx and Apache - Each web server should have it's own directory for easier understanding 

For this instance:
Install Docker-ce
mkdir nginx 
vi Dockerfile 
vi nginx.repo
vi nginx.conf 

Each file has been uploaded - Feel free to add or takeaway whatever suits your needs
